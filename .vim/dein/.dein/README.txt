INSTALATION:

To install vimball (vba) file you need to have Vimball Archiver plugin (see 
:h vimball). If you have it, just open the vba file within vim and source it
using the command:
	:source %	(or just :so %)

You can also copy the tar.gz file to your local vim directory (in Linux
$HOME/.vim)a nd extract it.  Then you need to update your helptags. It can be
done with:
	:helptags <path to your doc directory>
See :h helptags (your doc directory is the 'doc' directory inside your local
vim directory.

Now you can read the documentation for ATP with :help atp (this goes to table
of contents, you can also start from beginning with :help
automatic-tex-plugin)
